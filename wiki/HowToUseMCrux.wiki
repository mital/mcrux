#labels Phase-Design,Featured

== Getting Started ==

This article will be useful for JavaScript / HTML / CSS Programmer who are willing to write desktop applications using their same set of skills.

This article describes step by step procedure for getting started with MCrux.

== Getting The Binaries ==

you can get the binaries of MCrux in the featured download section shown on the Right corner of the "Project Home" page.

Extract MCrux_VersionNumber.zip to a directory.

== Creating MCruxSpec File ==

for creating an application the very first thing you need to do is to create a MCruxSpec File

checkout [http://code.google.com/p/mcrux/wiki/MCruxSpecFile mcruxspec File] section for more details on ".mcruxspec" files.

*Important*: for the current version of MCrux Binaries assumes that the ".mcruxspec" file is available as [c:\mcrux\myapplication.mcruxspec]. In future versions this dependency will be removed.

== Getting Various Plugins ==
for MCrux users we have developed a set of plugins you can download them and use it in your application.

please refer [http://code.google.com/p/mcrux/wiki/Plugins Plugins] section for more detail.

== Running The Application ==

after getting all the above and placing in appropriate place you can now run your application.

there is an executable file named "*MCrux_exe.exe*" which is shipped with the binary packages.

here you go.. just double click the executable and your application is running in ur PC.

*Note*: this is currently under development. I am planning to register the ext. ".mcruxspec" registered to the "MCrux_exe.exe" so that you just double click the mcruxspec file and it will run your application. :)
